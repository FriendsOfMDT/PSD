# Operations Guide

This guid is for standard operational guide when using PSD. For the latest updates refer to the [PowerShell Deployment - Latest Release Setup Guide.md](./PowerShell%20Deployment%20-%20Latest%20Release%20Setup%20Guide.md)

## Introduction

PSD enabled deployments works the same as standard MDT Lite Touch Deployments. They can be initiated via PXE, or via Boot Media (ISO/USB). Here follows a list of common operations actions for the PSD solution

### Import Operating Systems

Within MDT Deployment workbench, on the newly created PSD Deployment share, import/create/copy any desired Operating Systems. Follow MDT-provided instructions and techniques.

>PRO TIP: You can copy Operating Systems from other MDT deployment shares within the Deployment Workbench.

### Create PSD Task Sequence

You **MUST** create a new Task Sequence from the PSD Templates within the workbench. PSD will fail otherwise. Do not attempt to clone/copy/import or otherwise work around this step. Some steps are required for PSD functionality. Do not delete any of the PSD task sequence steps - you may disable steps in the PSD Template task sequences if you choose.

>PRO TIP: If you upgrade PSD version at a later date, **expect** to recreate your task sequences from the new PSD templates.


### Create Applications

Within MDT Deployment workbench, on the newly created PSD Deployment share, import/create/copy any desired Applications. Follow MDT-provided instructions and techniques. Make note of application's unique GUIDs for use automating application installation with CustomSettings.ini.

>PRO TIP: You can copy Applications from other MDT deployment shares within the Deployment Workbench.

>BUG: Be sure to add a dummy app to `customsettings.ini`. THere is a glitch if you want to use application selection in the new PSDWizard

### Import/Add Drivers

Within MDT Deployment workbench, on the newly created PSD Deployment share, import/create/copy any desired drivers. After adding new drivers to MDT using the "total control method" (OS/Make/Model, or OS/Model, etc. ), you need to run the `New-PSDDriverPackage.ps1` to generate the ZIP or WIM archives. One ZIP or WIM archive is created for each OS and Model and copied to the PSDResources\DriverPackages

>PRO TIP: You can copy drivers from other MDT deployment shares.

Sample syntax:
```powershell
.\New-MDTDriverPackage.ps1 -psDeploymentFolder "E:\PSDProduction" -CompressionType WIM
```

```powershell
.\New-MDTDriverPackage.ps1 -psDeploymentFolder "E:\PSDProduction" -CompressionType ZIP
```

### Check Deployment Share Permissions

By default, the PSD installer creates an MDT folder structure for PSD. PSD-specific files , scripts and templates are added and a new SMB share is created if specified. Ensure that the necessary domain and/or local computer user accounts have access to the PSD Share.

>PRO TIP: Only grant the *minimum necessary rights* to write logs in the PSD share. Only **READ** rights are required for the PSD/MDT share.

### Update Windows PE settings

Update the MDT WinPE configurations panels including the following settings:

- WinPE Custom Wallpaper (see notes below)
- WinPE Extra Directory (configured by default)
- ISO File name and generation
- WIM file name and generation

### Enable MDT monitoring

Enable MDT Event Monitoring and specify the MDT server name and ports to be used.

### Update CustomSettings.ini

Edit and Customize `customsettings.ini` to perform the necessary and desired automation and configuration of your OSD deployments. These should be settings to affect the installed OS typically. Be sure to configure new PSD properties and variables.

> PRO TIP: Recommend using the latest `customsettings.ini` provided in repo. This requires that your sections and settings will have to be migrated and tested as well

### Update BootStrap.ini

Edit and customize `bootstrap.ini` for your any necessary and desired configuration of your OSD deployments. These should be settings to affect the OSD environment typically. Be sure to configure new PSD properties and variables.

> PRO TIP: Recommend using the latest `bootstrap.ini` provided in repo. If using the new PSDDeployRoots property, remove *all* reference to DeployRoot from BootStrap.ini.

### Update Background wallpaper

By default, a new PSD themed background wallpaper (PSDBackground.bmp) is provided. It can be found at Samples folder of the MDT installation. Adjust the MDT WinPE Customizations tab to reflect this new bmp (or use your own).

### Configure Extra Files

Create and populate an ExtraFiles folder that contains anything you want to add to WinPE or images. Things like CMTRACE.EXE, wallpapers, etc.

>PRO TIP: Create the same folder structure as where you want the files to land (e.g. \Windows\System32)

### Readiness

PSD now runs a default script _Computer_Readiness.ps1_ from PSDResources\Readiness folder. Edit this file with new functions or create a new readiness script. Be sure to update the property in CustomSetting.ini. If Deployment Readiness page is enabled, a valid file path **must** be used.

### Certificates

Be sure to export the full chain of certificates to PSDResources\Certificates folder. This is required for HTTPS PSD shares

### Configure WinPE Drivers

Using MDT Selection Profiles, customize your WinPE settings to utilize an appropriate set of MDT objects. Be sure to consider Applications, Drivers, Packages, and Task Sequences.

### Generate new Boot Media

Using MDT Deployment workbench techniques, generate new boot media. By default the installer, will configure NEW PSD deployment shares to be PSDLiteTouch_x64.iso and PSDLiteTouch_x86.iso. Rename these if necessary.
