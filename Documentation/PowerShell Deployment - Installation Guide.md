## PSD Configuration Checklist
The following actions should be completed as part of PSD installation:

* [ ] **Install PSD** - Install PSD on a machine with ADK and MDT already installed. Install PSD either as a NEW deployment share or as an UPGRADE to an existing MDT deployment share. Detailed PSD installation instructions can be found in the [PSD Installation Guide](https://github.com/FriendsOfMDT/PSD/blob/master/Documentation/PowerShell%20Deployment%20-%20Installation%20Guide.md).

* [ ] **Open PSD share in MDT** - Following installation of PSD, navigate to and open the newly created PSD deployment share in the MDT Workbench

* [ ] **Import Operating Systems** - Within MDT Workbench, on the newly created PSD Deployment share, import/create/copy any desired *operating systems*. Follow MDT-provided instructions and techniques. 
    >PRO TIP: You can copy Operating Systems from other MDT deployment shares.

* [ ] **Create Applications** - Within MDT Workbench, on the newly created PSD Deployment share, import/create/copy any desired *applications*. Follow MDT-provided instructions and techniques. Make note of application's unique GUIDs for use automating application installation with CustomSettings.ini.
    >PRO TIP: You can copy applications from other MDT deployment shares.

* [ ] **Import/Add Drivers** - Within MDT Workbench, on the newly created PSD Deployment share, import/create/copy any desired *device drivers*. Follow MDT-provided instructions and techniques. Make note of their unique GUIDs for use automating driver installation using CustomSettings.ini.
    >PRO TIP: You can copy drivers from other MDT deployment shares.

* [ ] **Import/Add Language Packs** - Within MDT Workbench, on the newly created PSD Deployment share, import any desired *language packs*. Follow MDT-provided instructions and techniques. Make note of their unique GUIDs for use automating language pack installation using CustomSettings.ini.
    >PRO TIP: You can copy language packs from other MDT deployment shares.

* [ ] **Check Deployment Share Permissions** - By default, the PSD installer creates an MDT folder structure for PSD. PSD-specific files , scripts and templates are added and a new SMB share is created if specified. Ensure that the necessary domain and/or local computer user accounts have access to the PSD share. 

    >PRO TIP: Only grant the *minimum necessary rights* to write logs in the PSD share. Only **READ** rights are required for the 
    PSD/MDT share.

* [ ] **Enable MDT/PSD Logging** - By default, the PSD installer pre-creates folders for LOGS and DYNAMIC LOGS in the root of the PSD deployment share along with configuring an SMB share if specified. (You may wish to point PSD logs somewhere else.) Ensure that the necessary domain and/or local computer user accounts have read and write access to the **LOGS** folders. 

    >PRO TIP: Only grant the *minimum necessary permissions and access* to write logs in your location

* [ ] **Update Windows PE settings** - Update the MDT WinPE configuration panels including the following settings:
- WinPE custom wallpaper (see notes below)
- WinPE extra directory (configured by default)
- ISO file name and generation
- WIM file name and generation
    >PRO TIP: Be sure to configure *BOTH* x86 and x64 WinPE settings.

* [ ] **Enable MDT monitoring** - Enable MDT Event Monitoring and specify the MDT server name and ports to be used. ![Event Monitoring configuration](images/Config/PSDConfig-Event.png "Event Monitoring")

* [ ] **Update CustomSettings.ini** - Edit and Customize *CustomSettings.ini* to perform the necessary and desired automation and configuration of your OSD deployments. These should be settings to affect the installed OS typically. Be sure to configure new PSD properties and variables. See XXX for more details.
    >PRO TIP: If using the new PSDDeployRoots property, remove *all* reference to DeployRoots from CustomSettings.ini. All other MDT techniques and settings still apply.

* [ ] **Update BootStrap.ini** - Edit and customize *BootStrap.ini* for any necessary and desired configuration options of your OSD deployments. These should be settings to affect the OSD environment typically. Be sure to configure new PSD properties and variables. See XXX for more details.
    >PRO TIP: If using the new PSDDeployRoots property, remove *all* reference to DeployRoots from BootStrap.ini. All other MDT techniques and settings still apply.

* [ ] **Review and adjust PSD Variables** - blah

* [ ] **Update Background Wallpaper** - By default, a new PSD themed background wallpaper (PSDBackground.bmp) is provided. It can be found in the Samples folder of the MDT installation. Adjust the MDT WinPE customization tab to reflect this new bmp (or use your own).
    >PRO TIP: Custom wallpapers should be 800x600 resolution.

* [ ] **Configure Extra Files** - Create and populate an ExtraFiles folder that contains anything you want to add to WinPE or images. Things like CMTRACE.EXE, wallpapers, etc.
    >PRO TIP: Create the same folder structure as where you want the files to land (e.g. \Windows\System32\)

    >PRO TIP WARNING: If using WinPE v1809, you **MUST** source and stage **BCP47Langs.dll** and **BCP47mrm.dll**, otherwise the PSD deployment wizard and final WinForms will crash.

* [ ] **Configure WinPE Drivers and Patches** - Using MDT Selection Profiles, customize your WinPE settings to utilize an appropriate set of MDT objects. Be sure to consider Applications, Drivers, Packages, and Task Sequences.
    >PRO TIP: You may want to create a new or custom Selection Profile unique to your new PSD-enabled PE environment.

* [ ] **Generate new Boot Media** - Using MDT Workbench techniques, generate new boot media. By default, the installer will configure *new* PSD deployment shares to be PSD_LTI_x64.iso and PSD_LTI_x86.iso. Rename these if necessary.
    >PRO TIP: PSD increases the size of boot media due to additional components. This may affect your ability to deploy on low-spec equipment.

* [ ] **Content Caching and Network Traffic Shaping** - Integrate, configure and test any necessary or required software and solutions that shape network traffic or cache content. This may include:
- Peer Caching
- Branch Cache
- Delivery Optimization
- 2 Pint software
- 1E Nomad
- Hardware-based content caching solutions (F5)
    >PRO TIP: When setting up and testing PSD for the first time, stick to the basics and eliminate caching and traffic shaping until you're comfortable with PSD functionality.

* [ ] **Review Network, Firewall and Active Directory** - If you're deploying Windows 10 for the first time, be sure to review the following:
- Active Directory Group Policies (specifically for Windows 10 settings)
- Network Firewall settings
- Windows 10 firewall settings
- PXE availability
- Windows Deployment Services
    >PRO TIP: Create a new Organizational Unit for both PSD testing and on-going Windows 10 administration

    >PRO TIP: Be on the lookout for multiple (or rogue) PXE servers on the network

* [ ] **Configure IIS for PSD over HTTP/S** - Install and configure IIS and WebDAV). See the [IIS Configuration Guide](https://github.com/FriendsOfMDT/PSD/blob/master/Documentation/PowerShell%20Deployment%20-%20IIS%20Configuration%20Guide.md) for details.
    - [ ] Install IIS
    - [ ] Install and configure WebDAV
    - [ ] Test your HTTP/S PSD functionality
    >PRO TIP: The PSD IIS installation script expects to find a clean environment without IIS or WebDAV installed.

* [ ] **Create PSD Task Sequence** - You **MUST** create a new Task Sequence from the PSD Templates within the Workbench. PSD will fail otherwise. Do not attempt to clone/copy/import or otherwise work around this step. Some steps are required for PSD functionality. Do not delete any of the PSD task sequence steps - you may disable steps in the PSD Template task sequences if you choose.

    >PRO TIP: If you upgrade PSD version at a later date, **expect** to recreate your task sequences from the new PSD templates.
