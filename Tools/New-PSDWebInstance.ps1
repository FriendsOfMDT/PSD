.Synopsis
    This script is designed to work with the PSD Toolkit to install and configure IIS as needed for the solution to deploy Windows over the internet. 
    This script will install the IIS feature set and the components required for WEBDav

.Description
    This script was written by Jordan Benzing @JordanTheITGuy in partnership with TrueSec and 2Pint. This script is for the friends of MDT deployment tools 
    and is responsible for making the required IIS components work for PSD

    Updated:    2019-04-18

    Version 0.0.0 (2019-04-15) Wrote out framework for code base imported standard helper functions
	Version 0.1.0 (2019-04-15)- Created a functional version of the script installs IIS, installs WebDav - reboots server to complete setup and then starts WEbDave Services
	Version 0.1.1 (2019-04-17) - Created switches for "install" v.s. Configure
				  			   - Created New function that does the configuration so that we can add all configuration changes in one place
				  			   - Created a switch for reboot
				  			   - Blocked the behaviour so that someone cannot call Install AND configure - without a reboot
	Version 0.2.0 (2019-04-18) - Updated the Logic for the configure step so it can be modified seperately from the installation step
							   - Implemented a check that prevents you from running the script if the script is targeting the local server (Can't handle reboot)
	Version 0.3.1 (2019-04-18) - Use a variable LIST of all features that need to be installed now for IIS
							   - Wrote out a function for confiugre
							   - crossed off numerous TODO functioanlity checks
							   - Some Code optimization from repeat sections
	Version 0.3.2 (2019-04-19) - Increased the functionality of the reboot handler
							   - Now ALLOW you to reboot the local computer but only if Configure wasn't requested
							   - Now prompts to confirm the reboot 
	Version 0.3.3 (2019-04-19) - Now retrieves network information about the client starting the install and the target machine and logs it.
							   - May include a "debug" option in the WRite-PSD log function in the future.. 
	Version 0.3.4 (2019-04-19) - Updated from PSD to PSD - on all the function
							   - Moved the start-log function back to the begin block to make it work properly. 
	Version 0.3.5 (2019-04-22) - Corrected the process currently for the installtion/configuration steps. Validation of final testing steps Now needs to occur.
	Version 0.4.0 (2019-04-23) - Removed the TODO: Block from the script header. All to do's will now be finalized trough GITHUB project workflow. 
							   - Re-organized the code layout/structure for readabiltiy with regions in process block
							   - Refactored the install code to use a list install instead of feature by feature
							   - NOTE - commented out the old code did not remove - want to save as an "Advanced" installer methd for troubleshooting which feature fails in the future
							   - Introduced time tracking on the script to log the duration of the install or configuration.
	Version 0.4.1 (2019-04-23) - Confirmed Install Command works - Still no complete resolution on Logging function not erroring out while the script is running. 
							   - Confirmed Configure Works - Now need to enhance functionality
							   - Resolved Issue Tracked on Github #1
	Version 0.4.2 (2019-04-24) - Resolved The following Github Issues
							   - #3 Install Script Doesn't Check if Already Run 
							   - #10 New-PSDWebinstance.ps1 cannot run -configure multiple times 
							   - #9 Variable names and check for folder
							   - #8 Uppercase N in New
							   - #7 MIME type being set a second time causes terminating error -> Interealated to Numbers #3 and #10
	Version 0.4.3 (2019-04-24) - Updated the psDeploymentShare parameter to meet the criteria of being called psDeploymentFolder per Bug #9
	Version 0.4.4 (2019-04-24) - Updated the {} structure to follow the styling that Niehaus is using. Per Bug #6
							   - Validated Code works in Version - Dev Test SignOff
							   - Added parameter information to the powerShell Get-Help block.
							   - Added functional examples to the PowerShell Get-Help Block
	Version 0.4.5 (2019-04-25) - Discovered a Microsoft Bug with IIS PowerShell Cmdlets developed a way around it by implementing an older command style to first populate the needed
							   - Attributes and then move on. This related to Bug #12
	Version 0.4.6 (2019-05-01) - Configured same settings on the Default Web Site related to WebDav 
								- Logging an issue with not being able to hide the AppCMD output will update an issue tracking number tomorrow
	Version 0.4.7 (2020-06-30) - Script separated into two diffrent scripts, this script will install the roles needed.
                                - The script only works when running locally on the server.
